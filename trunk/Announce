Dear WhizzyTeX users and maintainers,

It is my pleasure to announce the new release 1.3.6 of WhizzyTeX. 

WhizzyTeX is an Emacs minor mode for incrementally viewing LaTeX documents
that you are editing. It works under Unix with gv, xpdf, and xdvi viewers,
but the Active-DVI viewer (see http://advi.inria.fr/) will provide
better visual effects and will offer more functionalities.

The source code, documentation, and information are available at

        http://gallium.inria.fr/whizzytex/

Bug reports to whizzytex-bugs@inria.fr

This release is a maintanance release.  It contains several bug fixes and 
only a few visible improvements since version 1.3.1.  See CHANGES on the
whizzytex website for more details.

Enjoy, 

        Didier Rémy
