Dear WhizzyTeX users and maintainers,

It is my pleasure to announce a new release of WhizzyTeX. 

WhizzyTeX is an Emacs minor mode for incrementally viewing LaTeX documents
that you are editing. It works under Unix with gv and xdvi viewers, but the
Active-DVI viewer (see http://pauillac.inria.fr/activedvi/) will provide
much better visual effects and will offer more functionalities.

Version 1.3.0 is now available. 

The source code, documentation, and information are available at

        http://cristal.inria.fr/whizzytex/

Bug reports to whizzytex-bugs@pauillac.inria.fr

This release is mostly a maintanance release.  It contains several bug fixes
and a only few visible improvements since version 1.2, which are: 

 - Easier configuration for recent tetex distributions without "initex"
 - Some support for use with PDF viewers 

See the web site for more details. 

Enjoy, 

        Didier Rémy 


PS:

To keep informed of upgrades, check the WhizzyTeX WEB page occasionally, or
