Dear WhizzyTeX users and maintainers,

It is my pleasure to announce the new release 1.4.0 of WhizzyTeX. 

WhizzyTeX is an Emacs minor mode for incrementally viewing LaTeX documents
that you are editing. It works under Unix with gv, xpdf, and xdvi viewers,
but the Active-DVI viewer (see http://advi.inria.fr/) will provide
better visual effects and will offer more functionalities.

The source code, documentation, and information are available at

        http://gallium.inria.fr/whizzytex/

The source code is also available on github:

        https://github.com/diremy/whizzytex/

Bug reports to https://github.com/diremy/whizzytex/issues

This release is for compatibility with recent changes in texlive
See CHANGES on the whizzytex website for more details.

Enjoy, 

        Didier Rémy
