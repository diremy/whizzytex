\begin{document}

This example illustrate customization of the whizzytex shell with a
\texttt{whizzy.sh} file in the current directory. This file contains
\begin{verbatim}
        AUTORECOMPILE=false
\end{verbatim}
The effect is to switch off recompilation of the whole file when the
the document is reformatted or saved. 

You can also control this switch interactively, by typing
\begin{verbatim}
        autorecompile on
\end{verbatim}
or
\begin{verbatim}
        autorecompile off
\end{verbatim}
in the interaction window. 

Then, the whole document will only be compiled at startup, which you may
also control by switching flag \texttt{AUTOCOMPILE}.
