This example illustrate customization of the whizzytex shell with a
\texttt{main.wsh} file in the current directory. This file contains
\begin{verbatim}
        AUTORECOMPILE=false
\end{verbatim}
The effect is to switch off recompilation of the whole file when the
the document is reformatted (for example, when the document is saved). 

You can also control this switch interactively, by typing
\begin{verbatim}
        autorecompile on
\end{verbatim}
or
\begin{verbatim}
        autorecompile off
\end{verbatim}
in the interaction window.
