1. Installation
----------------

   To use whizzytex, you nead emacs or xemacs, latex2e, and bash installed.
   Get the source whizzytex.tgz, untar it in some working directory.

gunzip whizzytex-1.0.tgz
tar -xf whizztex-1.0.tar
ls -1 whizzytex

   Then, the installation can be automatic, or manual.

1.1  Automatic installation
---------------------------

   By  default, librairies will be installed in /usr/local/lib/whizzytex/
   and in Emacs site-lisp library. 

./configure  

   produces Makefile.config, which you can edit and modify. 

   To produced configured copies of the source and install them, type

make all
make install


1.2  Manual installation
-------------------------

  1.2  Manual installation
  
   Since  WhizzyTeX  only  need  three files installed, these can also be
   installed by hand:

   whizzytex.el

       This  should be installed in a directory visible by emacs, so that
       it can be autoloaded, or loaded by hand.
       No default location.

   whizzytex

       This  is  a  bash-shell script that should be executable. There is
       not  reason  to  have it visible from the executabl path, since it
       should not be used but with WhizzyTeX.
       The   variable   whizzytex-command-name  defined  in  whizzytex.el
       contains  its  full  path  (or  just  its name if visible from the
       executable path).
       Default value is /usr/local/lib/whizzytex/whizzytex

   whizzytex.sty

       This  is  a latex2e macros package. There is no reason to put this
       visible  from  LaTeX  path, since it should not be used but with
       WhizzyTeX.
       Variable  variable  PACKAGE defined in whizzytex the full path (or
       just the name if the path is visible from LaTeX.
       Default value is /usr/local/lib/whizzytex/whizzytex.sty
       

2.  Using WhizzyTeX
-------------------

  2.1  Quit start
  
   WhizzyTeX  runs  as  a minor mode of emacs to be launched on a LaTeX
   emacs  buffer.  One  the  library  whizzytex.el  has  been loaded (you
   propbably  want  to  declare  it  autoload in your Emacs startup file)
   simply type
                             
ESC-X whizzytex-mode                  

   By  default,  this  should add new bindings so that you can later turn
   mode on and off with key strokes C-C C-W. 

   When  whizzytex-mode is started for the first time on a new buffer, it
   may  prompt  for  confirmation  of  default  settings,  which  you may
   confirm,  change  interactively,  or  change  permanenty  by inserting
   comments in the source file (see manual for details).

   Once  in  whizzytex-mode,  just  type in as usual. WhizzyTeX should do
   everything  automatically,  refresshing  the presentation as you type.

   Additionally,  it  should  put  a  gray overlay outside of the current
   slice  (the  region  of  your  buffer that is under focus). Whenever a
   Latex  error  occors,  it will also attempt to localize the error in
   the source buffer and mark it with a yellow overlay.

   Furthermore,  when  an  error is persistent for several slices or some
   amount  of  time,  it will pop up its interaction-buffer with a log of
   the error (this option can be turn on or off from the Whizzy menu).
