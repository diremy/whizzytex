1 Installation 
==============

   To  use  whizzytex,  you  need  Emacs  or  XEmacs,  latex2e,  and bash
   installed, and at least one DVI or Postscript previewer, such as advi,
   xdvi, or dvips combined with gv.
   WhizzyTeX  has  been developed under Linux Redhat 7.2 but has not been
   extensively  tested  on  other  platforms. While LAT[E]X and Emacs are
   quite  portable,  you may run into compatibility problem with the bash
   shell-script.
   Get   the   source   whizzytex-1.00ii.tgz  from  the  [3]distribution,
   uncompress and untar it in some working directory, as follows:

        gunzip whizzytex-1.00ii.tgz
        tar -xvf whizztex-1.00ii.tar
        cd whizzytex-1.00ii

   Then,  the  installation  can be automatic (default or customized), or
   manual.

  1.1  Automatic installation
  ---------------------------

   By   default,   all   files   will   be  installed  in  the  directory
   /usr/local/lib/whizzytex/    and   Emacs-lisp   code   will   not   be
   byte-compiled. Then, just type:

        make all

   This  will  create  a  Makefile.config  file  (only if nonexistent) by
   taking a copy of the template Makefile.config.in. This will also check
   that  the  Makefile.config  (whether  it  is the default or a modified
   version) makes sense. If you wish to change the default configuration,
   or   if   your   configuration  is  rejected,  see  ``Customizing  the
   installation''  below.  This will also prepared configured versions of
   the files for installation.
   Finally, to install files to their final destination, type:

        make install

   See Using WhizzyTeX (Section [4]2) to test your installation.

  1.2  Customizing the installation
  ---------------------------

   To customize the installation, you can edit Makefile.config, manually.
   You may also use the command

        make config

   for  semi-automatic editions. This will test your system configuration
   and  choose  default values accordingly and prompt for confirmation or
   when  a  decision  need  to be taken. Of course, you can combine both,
   doing manual corrections at the end.
   The  automatic configuration only check for the existence of commands,
   but  will  not  test  their  interface. Moreover, manual configuration
   allows to choose commands that may not even exists.

   -- Checking Makefile.config

   A  misconfiguration of your installation, or ---much more subttle--- a
   misconfiguration  of  other  commands  (many installation wrap scripts
   around  standard commands that are sometimes incorrect and break their
   interface), may lead to systematic errors when launching WhizzyTeX. To
   prevent  delaying  such obvious errors, some sanity checks are done on
   the  file  Makefile.config  before building other files. This includes
   checking  for  mandatory bindings and for the conformance of latex and
   viewers  commands  to  their  expected interface. The later is done by
   simulating  the  core  of  a  small WhizzyTeX session: a small file is
   created,  a  specialed version of latex format is build for that file,
   and  used to run LAT[E]X on on the file; finally, all declared viewers
   are tested on the DVI output, which open windows, temporarily.
   If  the  sanity  check  fails,  at least part of your configuration is
   suspicious.  If  some  windows  remain  opened, your confirguration is
   likely to be erronesous (and so, even if not detected by the script).
   However,  if  you  really  know what you are doing, you may bypass the
   check   by   typing   make   config.force,   which   will  stamp  your
   Makefile.config as correct without checking it.
   At  the  end  of  customization,  proceed  as described in ``Automatic
   installation'' (Section [5]1.1)

   -- Customization guide

   By default, WhizzyTeX asumes the standard convention that latex is the
   command  name  used  to call LAT[E]X, initex, the command name used to
   build a new format, and that the latex predefined format is latex.
   These  values  may  be  changed  if you have another implementation of
   LAT[E]X  uses  other  names. Then, just redefine the variables INITEX,
   LATEX,  and  LATEXFMT  accordingly  in  the  file Makefile.config. For
   instance, platex could be use the default configuration

        INITEX = iniptex
        LATEX = platex
        LATEXFMT = platex

   If  you  wish  to  run  WhizzyTeX with several configuration, you must
   choose a default configuration, but you will be able to call WhizzyTeX
   with another configuration from emacs (see Section [6]3.1 below).

  1.3  Manual installation
  ---------------------------

   Since WhizzyTeX only need three files to run, installation can also be
   done manually:

   whizzytex.el
 
       This  could be installed in a directory visible by Emacs, but does
       not  need to, since you can always use the full path when you load
       it or declare autoload.
       No default location.

   whizzytex
 
       This  file is a bash-shell script that should be executable. There
       is  not  reason to have it visible from the executable path, since
       it should not be used but with WhizzyTeX.
       The   variable   whizzytex-command-name  defined  in  whizzytex.el
       contains  its  full  path  (or  just  its name if visible from the
       executable path).
       Default value is /usr/local/lib/whizzytex/bin/whizzytex

   whizzytex.sty
 
       This  file  are  latex2e  macros.  There  is no reason to put this
       visible  from  LAT[E]X  path, since it should not be used but with
       WhizzyTeX.
       Variable  variable  PACKAGE defined in whizzytex the full path (or
       just the name if the path is visible from LAT[E]X.
       Default value is /usr/local/lib/whizzytex/latex/whizzytex.sty

  1.4  Automatic upgrading
  ---------------------------

   For  convenience,  the distribution also offers a facility to download
   and  upgrade new versions of WhizzyTeX (this requires wget installed).
   If automatic upgrading does not work, just do it manually.
   All  operations  should  be  performed in the WhizzyTeX top directory,
   i.e. where you untar whizzytex for the first time. We assume that have
   created a link:

        ln -s whizzytex-1.00ii whizzytex

   (which  will  be  maintained  as  a  link  the  current version by the
   manager).  Alternatively,  you  can  use  whizzytex-1.00ii in place of
   whizzytex below. The main commands are:

        make -f whizzytex/Manager upgrade
        make -f whizzytex/Manager install

   The  command  upgrade  will  successively download the newest version,
   unpack it, copy the configuration of the current version to the newest
   version,  and bring the newest version up-to-date. The command install
   will install files of the newest version.
   The following command will (re-)install and old version:

        make VERSION=<version> download downgrade install


2  Using WhizzyTeX
==================


  2.1  Loading whizzytex.el
  ---------------------------

   Maybe,  whizzytex  is  already  installed  on your (X)Emacs system, by
   trying

        ESC x whizzytex-mode RET

   If this works, skip this section. Otherwise, you should first load the
   library  whizzytex.el  or,  better,  declare  it  autoload. To do this
   permanently,  include  the following declaration in your Emacs startup
   file (probably is ~/.emacs).

        (autoload 'whizzytex-mode
            "/usr/local/lib/whizzytex/lisp/whizzytex.el"
            "WhizzyTeX, a minor-mode WYSIWIG environment for LaTeX" t)

   (where   /usr/local/bin/whizzytex/lisp/whizzytex.el   is   the   exact
   location  of  whizzytex.el,  which  depends  on your installation.) If
   whizzytex.el  in your (X)Emacs load-path, or if you have adjusted this
   variable appropriately, you can simply write:

        (autoload 'whizzytex-mode "whizzytex"
            "WhizzyTeX, a minor-mode WYSIWIG environment for LaTeX" t)

  2.2  Quick start
  ---------------------------

   WhizzyTeX  runs  as  a minor mode of Emacs to be launched on a LAT[E]X
   Emacs buffer. To start it, type:

        ESC x whizzytex-mode RET

   By  default,  this  should add new bindings so that you can later turn
   mode  on  and  off  with key strokes C-c C-w. This will also add a new
   menu Whizzy in the menu bar call ``the'' menu below.
   When  whizzytex-mode is started for the first time on a new buffer, it
   attempts   to   configure  buffer  local  variables  automatically  by
   examining  the  content  of  file,  and using default values of global
   bindings.
   You  may  customize  default  settings globally by running appropriate
   hooks  or locally by inserting appropriate comments in the source file
   ---see the manual below.
   You may also change the settings interactively using the menu, or tell
   whizzytex-mode  to  prompt the user for local customization by passing
   prefix argument 4 (using, for instance, key sequence C-u C-c C-w).
