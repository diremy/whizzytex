1 Installation 
==============

   To  use  whizzytex,  you  need  Emacs  or  XEmacs,  latex2e,  and bash
   installed, and at least one DVI or Postscript previewer, such as advi,
   xdvi, or dvips combined with gv.
   WhizzyTeX  has  been developed under Linux Redhat 7.2 but has not been
   extensively  tested  on  other  platforms. While LAT[E]X and Emacs are
   quite  portable,  you may run into compatibility problem with the bash
   shell-script.
   Get   the   source  whizzytex-1.00iii.tgz  from  the  [3]distribution,
   uncompress and untar it in some working directory, as follows:

        gunzip whizzytex-1.00iii.tgz
        tar -xvf whizztex-1.00iii.tar
        cd whizzytex-1.00iii

   Then,  the  installation  can be automatic (default or customized), or
   manual.

  1.1  Automatic installation
  ---------------------------

   By   default,   all   files   will   be  installed  in  the  directory
   /usr/local/lib/whizzytex/    and   Emacs-lisp   code   will   not   be
   byte-compiled. Then, just type:

        make all

   This  will  create  a  Makefile.config  file  (only if nonexistent) by
   taking a copy of the template Makefile.config.in. This will also check
   that  the  Makefile.config  (whether  it  is the default or a modified
   version) makes sense. If you wish to change the default configuration,
   or   if   your   configuration  is  rejected,  see  ``Customizing  the
   installation''  below.  This will also prepared configured versions of
   the files for installation.
   Finally, to install files to their final destination, type:

        make install

   See Using WhizzyTeX (Section [4]2) to test your installation.

  1.2  Customizing the installation
  ---------------------------

   To customize the installation, you can edit Makefile.config, manually.
   You may also use either the command

        ./configure

   This  command  may be passed arguments to customize your installation.
   Call it with the option -help to see a list of all options.
   By  default,  the  configuration  is non interactive. However, you may
   call  it  with  option -helpme to have the script do more guessing for
   your and prompt for choices if needed.
   Note  that  by  default,  the  emacs-lisp  code  whizzytex.el  is  not
   byte-compiled.  You need to pass the option -elc to configure in order
   to do that.

   -- Checking Makefile.config

   A  misconfiguration of your installation, or ---much more subttle--- a
   misconfiguration of other commands (it appears that many installations
   wrap  scripts  around  standard  commands  that  are  often  sometimes
   incorrect  and  break  their normal interface), may lead to systematic
   errors  when  launching  WhizzyTeX.  To  prevent delaying such obvious
   errors, some sanity checks are done on the file Makefile.config before
   building  other  files.  These include checking for mandatory bindings
   and  for  the  conformance  of  initex, latex, and viewers commands to
   their expected interface.
   Checking  viewers  interface  implies  simulating  a  small  WhizzyTeX
   session:  a  small  test file is created, a specialed version of latex
   format is built for that file, and used to run LAT[E]X on on the file;
   finally, all declared viewers are tested on the DVI output, which open
   windows, temporarily.
   If  the  sanity  check  fails,  at least part of your configuration is
   suspicious.  If  some  windows  remain  opened, your confirguration is
   likely to be erronesous (and so, even if not detected by the script).
   However,  if  you  really  know what you are doing, you may bypass the
   check   by   typing   make   config.force,   which   will  stamp  your
   Makefile.config as correct without checking it. Checking compliance to
   viewers interface is also bypassed if you you do not have a connection
   to X.
   At  the  end  of  customization,  proceed  as described in ``Automatic
   installation'' (Section [5]1.1)

      Customization notes

   By  default,  WhizzyTeX  assumes the standard convention that latex is
   the  command  name used to call LAT[E]X, initex, the command name used
   to build a new format, and that the latex predefined format is latex.
   If  your  implementation of LAT[E]X uses other names, you may redefine
   the  variables  INITEX,  LATEX,  and  LATEXFMT accordingly in the file
   Makefile.config.  For  instance,  platex  could  be  use  the  default
   configuration

        INITEX = iniptex
        LATEX = platex
        LATEXFMT = platex

   This would be produced directly with the configuration line:

        ./configure -initex iniptex -latex platex -latexfmt latex

   If  you  wish  to  run WhizzyTeX with several configurations, you must
   still  choose  a  default  configuration, but you will be able to call
   WhizzyTeX  with  another  configuration from emacs (see Section [6]3.1
   below).
   Similarly,  you must at least chose one default previewer, and at most
   one  one default previewer for each previewer type advi, xdvi, and ps.
   However,  you will be able to call WhizzyTeX with other previewers but
   explicitly from emacs.

  1.3  Manual installation
  ---------------------------

   Since WhizzyTeX only need three files to run, installation can also be
   done manually:

   whizzytex.el
 
       This  could be installed in a directory visible by Emacs, but does
       not  need to, since you can always use the full path when you load
       it or declare autoload.
       No default location.

   whizzytex
 
       This  file is a bash-shell script that should be executable. There
       is  not  reason to have it visible from the executable path, since
       it should not be used but with WhizzyTeX.
       The   variable   whizzytex-command-name  defined  in  whizzytex.el
       contains  its  full  path  (or  just  its name if visible from the
       executable path).
       Default value is /usr/local/lib/whizzytex/bin/whizzytex

   whizzytex.sty
 
       This  file  are  latex2e  macros.  There  is no reason to put this
       visible  from  LAT[E]X  path, since it should not be used but with
       WhizzyTeX.
       Variable  variable  PACKAGE defined in whizzytex the full path (or
       just the name if the path is visible from LAT[E]X.
       Default value is /usr/local/lib/whizzytex/latex/whizzytex.sty

  1.4  Automatic upgrading
  ---------------------------

   For  convenience,  the distribution also offers a facility to download
   and  upgrade new versions of WhizzyTeX (this requires wget installed).
   If automatic upgrading does not work, just do it manually.
   All  operations  should  be  performed in the WhizzyTeX top directory,
   i.e. where you untar whizzytex for the first time. We assume that have
   created a link:

        ln -s whizzytex-1.00iii whizzytex

   (which  will  be  maintained  as  a  link  the  current version by the
   manager).  Alternatively,  you  can  use whizzytex-1.00iii in place of
   whizzytex below. The main commands are:

        make -f whizzytex/Manager upgrade
        make -f whizzytex/Manager install

   The  command  upgrade  will  successively download the newest version,
   unpack it, copy the configuration of the current version to the newest
   version,  and bring the newest version up-to-date. The command install
   will install files of the newest version.
   The following command will (re-)install and old version:

        make VERSION=<version> download downgrade install


2  Using WhizzyTeX
==================


  2.1  Loading whizzytex.el
  ---------------------------

   Maybe,  whizzytex  is  already  installed  on your (X)Emacs system, by
   trying

        ESC x whizzytex-mode RET

   If this works, skip this section. Otherwise, you should first load the
   library  whizzytex.el  or,  better,  declare  it  autoload. To do this
   permanently,  include  the following declaration in your Emacs startup
   file (probably is ~/.emacs).

        (autoload 'whizzytex-mode
            "/usr/local/lib/whizzytex/lisp/whizzytex.el"
            "WhizzyTeX, a minor-mode WYSIWIG environment for LaTeX" t)

   (where   /usr/local/bin/whizzytex/lisp/whizzytex.el   is   the   exact
   location  of  whizzytex.el,  which  depends  on your installation.) If
   whizzytex.el  in your (X)Emacs load-path, or if you have adjusted this
   variable appropriately, you can simply write:

        (autoload 'whizzytex-mode "whizzytex"
            "WhizzyTeX, a minor-mode WYSIWIG environment for LaTeX" t)

  2.2  Quick start
  ---------------------------

   WhizzyTeX  runs  as a minor mode of Emacs to be launched on an LAT[E]X
   Emacs  buffer.  The  extension of the buffer should be .tex. WhizzyTeX
   also  understands  .ltx  extensions,  but gives priority to the former
   when it has to guess the extension. Other extensions are not possible.

        The  file  attached  to  the  buffer  must  exists  and either be a
        well-formed  LAT[E]X  source  file,  or be mastered, i.e. loaded by
        another LAT[E]X source file. Thus, when the buffer is does not look
        well-formed  (it  does  not  contain  a  \begin{document} command),
        WhizzyTeX  will search for its master file, asking the user if need
        be,  so  as  to first launch itself on a buffer visiting the master
        file.  In  particular, an empty buffer will be considered as beeing
        mastered, which may not be what you intend. 

   To start WhizzyTeX on either kind of buffer, type:

        ESC x whizzytex-mode RET

   By  default,  this  should add new bindings so that you can later turn
   mode  on and off with key strokes C-c w. This will also add a new menu
   Whizzy in the menu bar call ``the'' menu below.
   When  whizzytex-mode is started for the first time on a new buffer, it
   attempts   to   configure  buffer  local  variables  automatically  by
   examining  the  content  of  file,  and using default values of global
   bindings.
   You  may  customize  default  settings globally by running appropriate
   hooks  or locally by inserting appropriate comments in the source file
   ---see the manual below.
   You may also change the settings interactively using the menu, or tell
   whizzytex-mode  to  prompt the user for local customization by passing
   prefix argument 4 (using, for instance, key sequence C-u C-c w).
