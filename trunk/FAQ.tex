\section {Where to find it}

The URL is \url{http://pauillac.inria.fr/whizzytex}

The last major release is 1
and the stable version is {\version}


\section {Known problems}

Fixed refers to last stable version.
\def \FIXED {\textit{Fixed in version > 1.1}}

\begin {enumerate}

\item
Its has been reported with versions of \textsf{XEmacs 21.4.*}
that sometimes the cursor move to the end of the buffer while typing.

So fars, this happens at unpredictable times and leaves the mark a few
characters before the point was when the cursor moved. 

I have seen this on someone else screen, but I have not yet been able to
reproduce it on my own machine. Any help to better identify this phenomenom
is welcome. 


\item Its does not work with the  \lst"x-symbol" package.

The  \lst"x-symbol" package should now work together with WhizzyTeX, 
provided you have a version of {\tt x-symbol} greater than v4.3.3. 

Alternatively, with (X)Emacs version 21 and above, you may set
\lst"whizzy-write-annotate" to nil to tell WhizzyTeX not to use
\lst"write-region-annotation-functions". The slice will be write slower, but
in a way so that the \lst"x-symbol" package should always be compatible with 
WhizzyTeX. 

You may also wish to set \lst"'x-symbol-auto-conversion-method" to
\lst"'fast".

\item How can a click in the \lst"advi" window reposition the point
in the emacs window?

First, you should be using the \lst"advi" previewer.  Then, check the
documentation of \lst"advi", since bindings may depend on versions. This is
likely to be \lst"shift-left-mouse" or \lst"left-mouse".

There might also be a short-cut that temporarily rebinds
\lst"shift-xxx-mouse" to \lst"xxx-mouse". This can be toggled by typing
\lst"e"   in the \lst"advi" or by calling \lst"advi" with the option
\lst"-edit". 
%
Note that \lst"shift-midddle-click" and \lst"shift-right-click" (or their
shortcut versions) are used for \lst"move" and \lst"resize" commands when
WhizzyEditting.


\end {enumerate}


\section {Using WhizzyTeX with platex}

WhizzyTeX has been designed to work with standard LaTeX.
However, it should also work  with other implementations of LaTeX, as long
as they allow the creation of new formats. 

As an example, to make it work with \lst"platex" you can edit 
the script \lst"whizzytex" and change some findings as follows
(in the experimental version): 
\begin{verbatim}
INITEX=iniptex
LATEX=platex
LATEXFMT=platex
\end{verbatim}
