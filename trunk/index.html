An <font color=blue>Emacs</font>  minor mode for<br>
<font color=blue>incremental viewing of <br>
LaTeX documents</font>. 
</h3>

<p> <font color=blue size="+1">WhizzyTeX</font> provides a minor mode for
Emacs or XEmacs, a (bash) shell-script daemon and some LaTeX macros.  It
works under Unix with <tt>gv</tt> and <tt>xdvi</tt> viewers, but the
<a href="http://pauillac.inria.fr/advi/">Active-DVI</a> viewer will provided
much better visual effects and will offer more functionalities.

<h4>Versions</h4>

The current 
version is <a href="whizzytex-1.00.tgz">whizzytex-1.00.tgz</a>


<h4><a href="manual.html">Documentation</a></h4>

Installation and manual are available in 
<a href="manual.html">HTML</a> and
<a href="manual.dvi">DVI</a> formats. 
<br>
Most of the documentation is also available as online Emacs help.

<h4>Disclaimer</h4>

WhizzyTeX is still under development and may contain dangerous bugs.
You may wish to save copies of the file (and of the whole directory you
are working in) before WhizzyTeX-ing.


<h4>Viewers</h4>

One of the problems that you will encounter with WhizzyTeX, especially 
if you have a relatively old slow machine is that the previewer flashes
whenever refreshing the page. 
<strong>xdvi</strong> is much faster but does not
render colors and messes up with most inlined-Postscript specials. 
Conversely, <strong>gv</strong> is much slower, but more compliant. 
Unfortunately, both flash when the page is refreshed. 
Thus, we recommend the use of <strong><code>advi</code></strong>
(Active-DVI) -see below.

<p>
<em> 
Alternatively, there is a patched version of <code>gv</code> (version 3.5.8)
written by <a href="http://para.inria.fr/~lefessan">Fabrice Le Fessant</a> that
inhibits flashing by drawing pages in a pixmap and flushing the page all at
once.  Here are the <a href="gv-3.5.8-patched.tgz">patched version</a> (and
its <a href="gv-3.5.8.tgz">original</a>). To remove flashing, 
<code>gv</code> must then be called with the option <code>-nopixmap</code>.
</em>


<h4><a href="http://pauillac.inria.fr/advi/">Active-DVI</a>
    <font color=red>(hightly recommended)</font></h4>

This is a previewer initially based on Mldvi, written <a
href="http://pauillac.inria.fr/~miquel">Alexandre Miquel</a> and extended
with many other features (correct handling of colors, of most
inlined-Postscript specials, hyperrefs, pauses, replays, etc.), and in
particular, with the ability to draw in the background and flush a page all
at once, so as to avoid any flashing effect. 

Moreover, advi offers can point back to source files, as long as the dvi
has been (automatically) instrumented with source file and line information
(as specials).  See the Active-DVI <a
href="http://pauillac.inria.fr/advi/">distribution</a>.
