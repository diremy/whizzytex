An emacs minor mode for incrementally previewing LaTeX
files.
</h2>

<p>
<font color=blue size="+1">WhizzyTeX</font>
provides a minor mode for emacs or xemacs, 
a (bash) shell-script deamon and some LaTeX macro definitions, 
and requires either ghostscript-based or dvi-based previewers. 
</strong>


<h4>Versions</h4>

The current version is 
<a href="whizzytex-1.0a.tgz">whizzytex-1.0a.tgz</a>
<br>
You can also use this <a href="whizzytex.old.tgz">older version</a>.


<h4>Documentation</h4>

Installation and manual are available in 
<a href="manual.html">HTML</a> and
<a href="manual.dvi">DVI</a> formats. 
<br>
Most of the documentation is also available as online Emacs help. 

<h4>Disclaimer</h4>

WhizzyTeX is still under development and may contain dangerous bugs.
We recommend you to save copies of the file (and of the whole directory you
are working in) before WhizzyTeX-ing.


<h4>Previewers</h4>

One of the problem that you will encounter with WhizzyTeX, especially in
if you have a relatively old slow machine is that the previewer flashes
whenever refreshing the page. 
<strong>xdvi</strong> is much faster but does not
render colors and messes up with most inlined-Postscript specials. 
Conversely, <strong>gv</strong> is much slower, but more compliant. 
Unfortunately, both flashes when the page is refreshed. 
Thus, we recommend the use of <strong><code>advi</code></strong>
(Active-DVI) -see below.

<p>
<em> 
Alternatively, there is a patched of <code>gv</code> (version 3.5.8) written
by <a href="http://para.inria.fr/~lefessan">Fabrice Le Fessant</a> that
inhibits flashing by drawing pages in a pixmap and flushing the page all at
once.  Here are the <a href="gv-3.5.8-patched.tgz">patched version</a> (and
its <a href="gv-3.5.8.tgz">original</a>). To remove flashing, 
<code>gv</code> must then be called with the option <code>-nopixmap</code>.
</em>


<h4>Active-DVI <font color=red>(hightly recommended)</font></h4>

This is a previewer based on Mldvi, written <a
href="http://pauillac.inria.fr/~miquel">Alexandre Miquel</a> and extended
with many other features (correct handling of colors, of most
inlined-Postscript specials, hyperrefs, pauses, replays, etc.), and in
particular, with the ability to draw in the background and flush a page all
at once, so as to avoid any flashing effect. 

More other, advi offers can point back to source files, as long as the dvi
has been (automatically) instrumented with source file and line information
(as specials).  See the Active-DVI <a
href="http://pauillac.inria.fr/advi/">distribution</a>.
