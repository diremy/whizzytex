This achive <a href="whizzytex.tgz"><code>whizzytex.tgz</code></a> provides 
an emacs minor mode and a shell-script deamon  for incrementally
previewing TeX files (configured to work either with ghostscript-based or
dvi-based previewers). 

<p>
The archive contains the following files:
<pre>
        whizzytex
        whizzytex.el
        whizzytex.sty
        Makefile.tpl
        manual.tex
        slides.tex
        CHANGES
</pre>
The three first files are enough to run <b>WhizzyTeX</b>. 
They can all be in the current working directory (but can be installed in
more appropriate places).
The  file <code>whizzytex</code> is a shell-script and should be executable.
<p>
The files <code>manual.tex</code> and <code>slides.tex</code>
are two examples that you can explore with WhizzyTeX. 
The latex source file <code>manual.tex</code> is a 
self-demonstrating <a href="whizzytex.dvi">documentation</a>. 
The file <code>Makefile.tpl</code> is a template to illustrate the use of
the command <code>make</code> as a preprocessor to LaTeX-ing and is used in
the example  <code>manual.tex</code> (it is definitely not a makefile for
installing WhizzyTeX). The file <code>CHANGES</code> list the most recent 
changes to the WhizzyTeX. 

<h4>Documentation</h4>
The file <code>artcile.tex</code> is actually a short documentation that you
can explore interactively with WhizzyTeX or read in 
<a href=whizzytex.dvi>DVI</a> or <a href=whizzytex.html>HTML</a> format. 

<h4>Disclaimer</h4>

WhizzyTeX is still under development and may contain dangerous bugs.
We recommend you to save copies of the file (and of the whole directory you
are working in) before WhizzyTeX-ing.

<h4>Previewers</h4>

One of the problem that you will encounter with WhizzyTeX, especially in
if you have a relatively old slow machine is that the previewer flashes
whenever refreshing the page. 
<code>xdvi</code> is much faster but does not
render the color while <code>gv</code> is much slower. Both flashes at each
refreshing of the page. 

We suggest two alternatives:
<ol>

<li> <strong><code>gv</code></strong>
<p>
<a href="http://para.inria.fr/~lefessan">Fabrice Le Fessant</a> has kindly
patched the version 3.5.8 of <code>GV</code> so as to avoid 
this problem, drawing in a pixmap and flushing the pixmap all at once. 
Here are the <a href="gv-3.5.8-patched.tgz">patched version</a> 
(and its <a href="gv-3.5.8.tgz">original</a>)
<p>
To remove flashing, you must then call <code>gv</code> with the option 
<code>-nopixmap</code>.

<br><br>
<li> <strong><code>advi</code></strong> (Active Dvi)
<p>

This is a DVI-previewer, written by 
<a href="http://pauillac.inria.fr/~miquel">Alexandre Miquel</a>
and extended by 
<a href="http://pauillac.inria.fr/~furuse">Jun Furuse</a>
and 
<a href="http://pauillac.inria.fr/~remy">myself Furuse</a>. 

<p> It is alike xdvi, but written in Ocaml. However, it handles colors and
Postscript specials better than xdvi.  Moreover, it recognizes a new kind of
specials <code>specials</code> (mldvi) that kind be used to make pauses,
record some and replay a sequence of xdvi. 

<p> More importantly, by default, advi draw the page in the background and
flushes the page altogether, which avoids flashing effect when redrawing a
page that is almost unchanged. This a requirement for WhizzyTeX, but also
quite useful for display slides with overlays.

<p>
See the Active Dvi 
<a href="http://pauillac.inria.fr/activedvi/">distribution</a>
(or pick the distribution under 
<A href="http://camlcvs.inria.fr/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/bazar-ocaml/mldvi/">
CVS</A> untill version 0.4 or higher are
made available)

Good options for "advi" are 

<pre>
advi -nowatch -html Start-Document OTHER-OPTIONS FILENAME
</pre>

</ol>
