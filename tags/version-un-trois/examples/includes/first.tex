%; whizzy-master main.tex

\section {This is the first included file}

\subsection {This is the first (sub)section of the slave}
 
This file {\tt first.tex} is mastered by {\tt master.tex}.  The slice is at
most the current file (but may be samller).  The slice is surrounded by
titles reminding the master, and written in such a way that positioning on
these in the previwer (if you are previeweing with advi) should point to the
master file (at a non-existing position interpretted as the old position).

You can edit the slave, move in the slave, or position in the previewer. 

You can also return to the master from emacs or by clicking on the master
text in the previewer.

\section {Another slice in the first slave}

The slave will only show its own slice (and the surronding master marks)

The slace can input another slace

\input {insidefirst}

Now we are back.
