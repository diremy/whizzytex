RECENT CHANGES:

Emacs-mode

 * error-report now first attempt to report the diff with the last sucessful
   slice if local (a single block of differences); otherwise it falls back
   to attempt to localize the error from the latex output.
 * new previewer mode -master for files that are leaves of other tex
   documents 
 * whizzytex-mode now ask the user to confirm default values for variables.
 * whizzytex-mode called with arg 16 recomputes default values for
   variables. 
 * whizzytex-mode called with arg 4 ask the user to confirm/change values
   for variables. 
 * whizzy-change-mode allows to change slicing mode while running. 
 * slicing speed ajusts automatically to the speed with which slices are
   processed. 
 * (small) compatibility with xemacs. Should work but without frames and
   overlays. 

Shell-script: 

 * Computes word-diff with the last successful slice.
 * The shell-script can either pause with "usleep" or stop itself with  
   "kill -STOP" when waiting for a new slice.
