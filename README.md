# WhizzyTeX

An Emacs minor mode for incremental viewing of LaTeX documents.

`WhizzyTeX` provides a minor mode for Emacs, a (bash) shell-script daemon
and some LaTeX macros. It works under Unix with gv and xdvi viewers, but the
Active-DVI viewer will provide much better visual effects and will offer
more functionalities.

# Warning!

You need version 1.4.0 or above to work with the lastest version of
latex.ltx in textlive 2021.
